# # 05 Third-Party APIs

## Our Task

Our task was to create a work day scheduler. We were given a starter code and had a few hints on what id's or classes we should use.

Below you will see the mock up example we were given & what the starter code looked like

We needed to make the current day show on the page using by using moments and we could display it in anyway we wanted. Following that we needed to get the time blocks to be relevant to a 9-5 working day and then colour code them base on Past, Present & Future events.

Majority of this was provided and it was just up to us to work the rest out

We had to give the user an option to save there date via a save button, these needed to still be present once the page was refreshed

Please see my final work day schedular in the image below as well as my link to the website
